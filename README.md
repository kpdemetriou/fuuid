# üè∑Ô∏è fuuid

FUUID stands for Functional Universally Unique IDentifier. FUUIDs are compatible with regular UUIDs but are naturally ordered by generation time, collision-free and support succinct representations such as raw binary and base58-encoded strings.

In short, running FUUIDs through the UNIX sort command will result in a list ordered by generation time.
